## 🌟 Key Features

### 📊 1. Excel (.xlsx, .xls) & CSV Contact Imports
- **Instant File Parsing:** Reads spreadsheets client-side via embedded `SheetJS` (no file uploads to external servers).
- **Smart Column Detection:** Automatically detects phone number headers (`Phone`, `Mobile`, `Contact`, `Tel`, etc.).
- **Live Sample Data Preview:** Under the column dropdown, instantly preview the first 4 phone numbers in formatted badges with non-numeric safety warnings.
- **Dynamic Variable Tags:** Insert custom columns into your message templates in 1 click (e.g. `Hi {Name}, your order #{Order_ID} for {Item} is confirmed!`).

### ✍️ 2. Manual Quick Dispatch
- Paste lists of phone numbers directly (comma, semicolon, or newline separated).
- Automatically sanitizes international phone numbers and strips formatting characters.

### 📎 3. Dual Attachment Modes (Zero "Forwarded" Tag)
- **Option 1: From My Chat (Recommended):** Forward media (photos, videos, documents) stored in your personal "Message Yourself" (You) chat. Built with anti-status protection so media is never accidentally sent to status stories.
- **Option 2: Direct Device Upload:** Directly attach photos, PDFs, or documents from your device into recipient conversations.
- **Sequence Flexibility:** Choose whether to send *Text First, then Attachment* (Default & Recommended) or *Attachment First, then Text*.
- **Mandatory Text Safeguard:** Enforces accompanying text messages to maintain conversational integrity.

### 🛡️ 4. Anti-Ban Humanized Dispatch Engine
- **Randomized Delays:** Set customizable minimum and maximum intervals (e.g. 5–15 seconds) between messages to emulate human pacing and evade spam heuristics.
- **Top Safety Notification Banner:** Displays a fixed alert banner across WhatsApp Web during active runs (`⚠️ DO NOT TOUCH WHATSAPP: Automation is active`).
- **One-Click Panel Minimize / Restore:** Minimize the drawer directly from the top banner to keep WhatsApp Web visible, or expand it anytime to inspect details.
- **Progressive Controls:** Dynamic `⏸ Pause`, `▶ Resume`, and `⏹ Stop` controls on both the banner and the drawer. Start buttons show live shimmer spinners: `⏳ Dispatching (X/Total)...`.
- **Fault-Tolerant Skipping:** Invalid numbers or network hiccups are gracefully caught, logged, and skipped without breaking the queue.

### 📜 5. Local Audit Logs & CSV Export
- Real-time in-drawer transaction table with color-coded badges (`Sent`, `Failed`, `Skipped`).
- Stores historical delivery records securely in `chrome.storage.local`.
- Export audit logs to downloadable CSV spreadsheets with one click.

## ⚠️ Anti-Ban Recommendations & Disclaimer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Use Responsibly:** WhatsApp enforces strict anti-spam guidelines. This software is intended for transactional notifications, customer updates, and communications to consenting contacts.

- **Warm-Up Your Account:** If your WhatsApp number is new, start with 20–30 messages per day and gradually increase.
- **Use Realistic Delays:** Never set delays below 5 seconds. A 7–15 second randomized interval closely mimics genuine human typing.
- **Personalize Messages:** Use `{Variables}` so each outgoing text is unique rather than identical bulk text.
- **Disclaimer:** *This project is an independent open-source tool and is not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with WhatsApp LLC or Meta Platforms, Inc.*
